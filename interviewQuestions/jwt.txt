Could you explain the different parts of a JWT token?

A JWT (JSON Web Token) is an open standard for securely transferring data between two parties using JSON as the primary data format.
The token consists of a header, payload, and signature.
The header contains information about type of token, signing algorithm used and other meta-information.
It is typically represented as a JSON object and contains two fields - "typ" which indicates the type of token and "alg" which shows the cryptographic algorithm used to generate the signature.
The payload (also known as the claim set) is the data that is being transferred between two parties.
This can include user information such as username, email address, or even an authentication token.
It is also typically represented as a JSON object.
The signature is a hash of the combined header and payload which is used to verify the authenticity and integrity of the token.
It is generated by applying a cryptographic algorithm to the header and payload.
In the code snippet below, we can see an example of how to generate a signature using the HMACSHA256 algorithm:
String secret = "my-secret";

String headerAndPayload = base64Encode(header) + "." + base64Encode(payload);

String signature = HmacSHA256(headerAndPayload, secret);
